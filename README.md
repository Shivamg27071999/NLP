# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and classify sentiments expressed in tweets as positive, neutral, or negative using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The dataset consists of various columns including tweet text, user information, and timestamps. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model for sentiment classification.

## Business Problem and Use Case Domain Understanding
- **Domain**: Social Media Sentiment Analysis
- **Business Problem**: Analyze and understand public sentiment towards various topics on Twitter by classifying tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
- **Use Case**: Sentiment analysis helps businesses monitor customer opinions, track brand reputation, and make informed decisions based on public feedback.

## Objective of the Project
To build a robust machine learning model to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. This involves preprocessing the data, building and tuning an LSTM model, and deriving insights from the analysis to help stakeholders understand public sentiment trends.

## Data Collection
While this project uses a pre-collected dataset, the typical approach to collecting Twitter data involves:
- Using APIs like Twitter API.
- Authenticating and connecting to the API.
- Defining query parameters to fetch relevant tweets.
- Storing the collected data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or DataFrame).

## Summary of the Data
- **Columns**: `target`, `ids`, `date`, `flag`, `user`, `text`
- **Target**: Sentiment labels (0 and 4) representing negative and positive sentiments.
- **Text**: Actual tweet content.
- **Date**: Timestamp of the tweet.
- **User**: User who posted the tweet.
- **Flag**: Non-informative column (constant value).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Column Renaming**: Renamed columns for better readability.
2. **Target Mapping**: Mapped target values: `0` to `negative`, `4` to `positive`.
3. **Date Parsing**: Parsed `date` column to extract `date_only`, `time`, and `year`.
4. **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Dropped the `flag` column.

### Data Manipulation Steps
1. **Tokenization**: Converted tweet text into sequences of tokens using Keras `Tokenizer`.
2. **Padding**: Padded sequences to a fixed length (300) for consistent input to the model.
3. **Label Encoding**: Encoded target labels into numerical values for model training.

### Univariate Analysis Steps
1. **Class Distribution**: Plotted the distribution of sentiment classes to check for balance.
2. **Tweet Frequency by Date**: Analyzed the number of tweets per day to identify peak activity periods.

### Bivariate Analysis Steps
1. **Sentiment by Date**: Examined sentiment trends over time to understand how sentiment varies by date.
2. **Sentiment by User**: Analyzed the distribution of sentiments by user to identify any significant patterns.

## Key Business Question
**How does public sentiment towards various topics on Twitter fluctuate over time, and what are the primary factors influencing these trends?**

## Conclusion (Key Findings Overall)
1. **Data Quality**: Cleaned and preprocessed data, including handling date-time formats and dropping irrelevant columns.
2. **Sentiment Distribution**: Identified potential class imbalance, with more tweets labeled as negative than positive.
3. **Peak Activity**: Found certain days with higher tweet activity, indicating potential events or news driving public engagement.
4. **Model Performance**: Built and tuned an LSTM model, achieving good accuracy in classifying tweet sentiments.
5. **Future Improvements**: Addressing class imbalance, exploring advanced embeddings, and using cross-validation could further improve model performance.
